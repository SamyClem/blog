# Density estimation

Let $(X_1,\ldots,X_n)$ be identically distributed real valued random variables whose common distribution has density $p$ with respect to the Lebesgue measure, i.e. $\mathbb{P}(X \in A) = \int_{A}p(x)dx$ for all $A \subset \mathbb{R}$. Our goal is to estimate $p$ from the data $(X_1,\ldots,X_n)$.
